> Compliance audit for the **Cyber Resilience Act** (Regulation EU 2024/2847) and the **BSI TR-03183** technical guideline — native for npm, Yarn and pnpm, and for **any language** through its SBOM.

`cra-audit` audits the installed dependencies of an npm project and checks the key requirements that the CRA imposes on "products with digital elements". It runs directly with `npx`, **without installation**, and has **no production dependencies** to minimize its own supply-chain surface.
It reads the project lockfile natively, so it works with **npm** (`package-lock.json` / `npm-shrinkwrap.json`), **Yarn** (classic v1 and Berry v2+ `yarn.lock`) and **pnpm** (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) — auditing the exact versions each package manager pinned. **Python, Go and Java** projects are read directly from `requirements.txt` / `poetry.lock` / `uv.lock` / `Pipfile.lock`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml` and `gradle.lockfile`, and **any other language** through the SBOM your tooling produces (`-i`) — [details](#8-other-languages-manifests-and-input-sbom).
```bash
# Run ALL the law's checks (Vulnerabilities + Licenses + SBOM)
npx cra-audit

# Interactive visual report (HTML) with maintenance data
npx cra-audit --visualize

# Just the SBOM part
npx cra-audit --sbom
npx cra-audit sbom check
```

---

## What it checks and why (mapping to the regulation)

Under the hood, the package runs the checks derived from the CRA legal obligations and the TR-03183 technical guideline:

### 1. Automatic SBOM validation

Generates and validates a **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** in a machine-readable format —**CycloneDX 1.6** (default) or **SPDX 2.3**— from the `package-lock.json` / `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `yarn.lock` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`, following the field mapping of **BSI TR-03183-2 v2.1.0**:

| TR-03183-2 data field | Where it comes from | CycloneDX 1.6 field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creator of the SBOM (email or URL) | `--creator`, `sbomCreator` policy, or the project's `author` / `homepage` / `repository` | `metadata.manufacturer` |
| Timestamp | generation time (UTC) | `metadata.timestamp` |
| Component creator (email or URL) | installed `package.json`: `author`, `maintainers`, `homepage`, `repository` | `components[].manufacturer` |
| Name, version, purl | lockfile | `name`, `version`, `purl` |
| Filename | tarball name (`left-pad-1.3.0.tgz`) | property `bsi:component:filename` |
| SHA-512 of the deployable component | lockfile `integrity` | `externalReferences[distribution].hashes` |
| Executable / archive / structured | npm tarball: `non-executable`, `archive`, `structured` | properties `bsi:component:*` |
| Dependencies + completeness | lockfile dependency graph (npm v1–v3, Yarn classic/Berry, pnpm v5–v9) | `dependencies`, `compositions[].aggregate` |
| Distribution / original licences | lockfile or installed `package.json` | `licenses[]` with `acknowledgement` `concluded` / `declared` |
| Source code URI | `repository` | `externalReferences[source-distribution]` |

`sbom check` verifies every one of those fields for every component. Licenses (for Yarn/pnpm) and component creators are read from `node_modules`, so **run it after installing dependencies** (e.g. after `npm ci` in CI).

Known limits: Yarn Berry lockfiles only store Yarn's own cache checksum, not the npm tarball SHA-512, so Berry projects fail the hash check. TR-03183-2 v2.1 requires **SPDX ≥ 3.0.1**; the SPDX output is still 2.3, so use CycloneDX for a conforming SBOM.

> CRA Annex I · TR-03183 Part 2 — *"Transparency through SBOM"*.

### 2. Known, actively exploited and malicious dependencies

Checks every **direct and transitive** dependency, at the exact version pinned in the lockfile, against:

| Source | What it finds | Effect on the audit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev) — GitHub Advisory Database | Known vulnerabilities, with severity, CVE aliases and the version that fixes them | Fails at or above `--fail-on` (default `high`) |
| OSV.dev — [OpenSSF malicious packages](https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages) | Compromised releases (`MAL-*`), e.g. the Shai-Hulud worm versions | **Always fails**; cannot be allowlisted |
| [CISA KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) | Vulnerabilities with evidence of **active exploitation** | Fails by default (`--no-fail-on-kev` to only warn) and shows the CRA Art. 14 deadlines that apply if it affects your product |

```text
  HIGH     [KEV] vite@6.2.3  (fix: vite@6.4.3)
    GHSA-4r4m-qw57-chr8 / CVE-2025-31125 Vite has a `server.fs.deny` bypassed … [KEV since 2026-01-22]

⚠ CRA Art. 14 — dependency with a known exploited vulnerability (CISA KEV)
    • Early warning ........ within 24 hours of becoming aware
    • Notification ......... within 72 hours
    • Final report ......... within 14 days after a corrective measure is available
```

Only package names and versions are sent to `api.osv.dev`; the KEV catalogue is downloaded from cisa.gov (or CISA's GitHub mirror). If KEV cannot be reached the report says so instead of silently passing, and if OSV.dev is unreachable the audit falls back to `npm audit`. `--vuln-source npm` uses `npm audit` directly.

> CRA Annex I Part I (2)(a) — *placed on the market without known exploitable vulnerabilities*. Art. 14 — *any actively exploited vulnerability contained in the product* must be notified, with an early warning within 24 hours of becoming aware. A KEV match means the vulnerability has been exploited somewhere: assess whether it is exploitable in your product and record the decision with VEX.

### 3. Third-party component check

Identifies every third-party open-source library present in the dependency tree and cross-references it against known security advisories, flagging vulnerable components and whether a fix is available.

> CRA — special attention to third-party developed components.

### 4. License and hash management

Verifies that **all** dependencies have their license documented and compliant with the policy (allowlist / denylist), and that they carry unique identifiers (`purl`) and integrity hashes (SHA-512/384/256) as recommended by TR-03183.

> TR-03183-2 §5.2 — license governance and hash integrity.

### 5. Visualization (`--visualize`)

Generates an **interactive, self-contained HTML report** (no external CDNs, works offline) that gathers, per package: SBOM, installed vs. latest published version, license, vulnerabilities and **maintenance signals** to assess how well each project is maintained:

- Last npm publish and number of maintainers.
- Associated repository.
- (Optional, with `--github`) **last commit** date, number of **contributors** and **stars**.
- **Deprecated** / **archived** indicators.
- A **maintenance score** (0-100) with a label *well-maintained / moderate / at-risk*.

The report includes summary cards, search, filters (vulnerable, outdated, license issues, at risk) and column sorting.

### 6. VEX — documenting exploitability (`vex`)

A known vulnerability in a dependency is not always exploitable in your product. Record your assessment in `.cra-audit.json` and `cra-audit` both **accepts** it in the audit and writes it to a **VEX** document (CycloneDX 1.6 or OpenVEX 0.2.0) — the place TR-03183-2 reserves for vulnerability data, outside the SBOM:

```json
{
  "vulnerabilities": {
    "allowlist": [
      {
        "id": "CVE-2020-11023",
        "package": "jquery",
        "status": "not_affected",
        "justification": "code_not_reachable",
        "detail": "We never pass untrusted HTML to jQuery DOM methods; content is rendered via textContent."
      },
      { "id": "GHSA-35jh-r3h4-6jhm", "status": "affected", "detail": "_.template used in the exporter; upgrade planned for 3.2.1." }
    ]
  }
}
```

| `status` | Accepted by the audit | CycloneDX `analysis.state` | OpenVEX `status` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `not_affected` (default) | ✔ | `not_affected` | `not_affected` |
| `false_positive` | ✔ | `false_positive` | `not_affected` |
| `affected` | ✖ | `exploitable` | `affected` |
| `under_investigation` | ✖ | `in_triage` | `under_investigation` |

`justification` accepts the CycloneDX values (`code_not_present`, `code_not_reachable`, `requires_configuration`, `requires_dependency`, `requires_environment`, `protected_by_compiler`, `protected_at_runtime`, `protected_at_perimeter`, `protected_by_mitigating_control`) or the OpenVEX ones, and is translated for each format. Findings without an assessment are written as *in triage* / *under investigation*; malicious packages are always *exploitable* / *affected*. Accepting a vulnerability without `justification` or `detail` works, but the audit warns about it.

```bash
npx cra-audit vex -o vex.cdx.json                    # CycloneDX 1.6 VEX
npx cra-audit vex --format openvex -o vex.openvex.json
```

### 7. CRA readiness (`readiness`)

Checks the vulnerability-handling duties that live in the repository itself:

| Check | Level | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SECURITY.md` (root, `.github/` or `docs/`) | required | CRA Annex I Part II (5) |
| Email address or reporting URL for vulnerabilities | required | Annex I Part II (6) · Annex II (2) |
| Support period with an end date or duration | required | Art. 13(8) · Annex II (7) |
| No unfilled `TODO` placeholders | required | Annex II |
| `security.txt` `Contact` and a future `Expires` (when present) | required | RFC 9116 |
| A lockfile to build the SBOM from | required | Annex I Part II (1) |
| Supported versions, response times, Art. 14 process (CSIRT/ENISA), `security.txt`, `repository` link | recommended | Annex II · Art. 14 |

```bash
npx cra-audit readiness          # exit code 1 when a required check fails
npx cra-audit readiness --init   # creates SECURITY.md and .well-known/security.txt templates (never overwrites)
```

`--init` prefills the templates from `package.json` (GitHub private vulnerability reporting link, supported major version, a coordinated disclosure process and the Art. 14 24 h / 72 h / 14 days reporting commitments); fill in the `TODO` placeholders and run it again.

### 8. Other languages: manifests and input SBOM

**Read directly — just run `npx cra-audit` in the project folder (no package.json needed):**

| Ecosystem | Files | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `Pipfile.lock` (exact); otherwise `requirements*.txt` | Only `==` pins are audited; ranges are skipped and reported, never guessed. `-r` includes, extras, markers and `--hash` lines are handled. |
| Go | `go.mod` | Every required module (direct and `// indirect`), with `replace` directives applied. |
| Java | `gradle.lockfile` (exact), `pom.xml` | `pom.xml`: declared dependencies with `${property}` and `<dependencyManagement>` resolution; transitive ones need a Maven-generated SBOM. |

Findings point at the exact line of the manifest (in the console and in SARIF). A folder with both an npm lockfile and one of these manifests (e.g. a front end next to a Go API) is audited as a whole. Manifests do not carry licenses or hashes, so for these ecosystems the audit **warns** instead of generating a TR-03183 SBOM: commit the one your build produces and audit it with `-i`.

```text
  Sources: OSV.dev … · 4 components from requirements.txt, go.mod, pom.xml (golang, maven, pypi)
  pom.xml: declared dependencies only; commit a Maven-generated SBOM (cyclonedx-maven-plugin) to audit transitive ones
  CRITICAL [KEV] org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core@2.14.1  (fix: org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core@2.25.4)
```

**Input SBOM (`-i`), any language:**

`audit`, `vuln`, `licenses` and `vex` accept an existing **CycloneDX JSON**, **SPDX 2.x JSON** or **SPDX 3.0 JSON-LD** SBOM instead of the npm lockfile. Every component is looked up in OSV.dev by its **Package URL**, so you get the same checks — known vulnerabilities, **malicious packages**, **CISA KEV** with the Art. 14 deadlines, licenses, VEX and SARIF — for any ecosystem OSV covers (Maven, PyPI, Go, crates.io, NuGet, Packagist, RubyGems, Hex, Pub, npm…).

```bash
# Generate the SBOM with the tool of your ecosystem…
syft dir:. -o cyclonedx-json=sbom.cdx.json          # any language / container images
cdxgen -o sbom.cdx.json .                            # multi-language
mvn org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-maven-plugin:makeAggregateBom   # Maven → target/bom.json
cyclonedx-py environment -o sbom.cdx.json            # Python

# …and audit it (no package.json needed)
npx cra-audit -i sbom.cdx.json
npx cra-audit vex -i sbom.cdx.json -o vex.cdx.json
npx cra-audit -i sbom.cdx.json --sarif cra-audit.sarif
```

```text
  Sources: OSV.dev … · CISA KEV (1721 entries) · 5 components from sbom.spdx.json (cargo, golang, maven, nuget) · 1 without purl skipped
  CRITICAL [KEV] org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core@2.14.1  (fix: org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core@2.25.4)
    GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q / CVE-2021-44228 Remote code injection in Log4j [KEV since 2021-12-10]
  CRITICAL smallvec@1.6.0  (fix: smallvec@1.6.1)
  HIGH     Newtonsoft.Json@12.0.1  (fix: Newtonsoft.Json@13.0.1, breaking)
```

Notes:
- Components without a purl are skipped and counted in the output. Operating-system packages (deb/rpm/apk) are not looked up.
- `--production` skips components with CycloneDX scope `optional`/`excluded` (or SPDX `DEV_DEPENDENCY_OF`).
- The input SBOM is also checked against TR-03183-2; since third-party generators rarely include the manufacturer fields, gaps are reported as a **warning** in the audit (`cra-audit sbom check -i` shows the details and fails on them). For npm projects, `cra-audit sbom generate` produces a conforming SBOM.
- SARIF alerts point at the line of the component's purl in the SBOM file.

### 9. Where to report: your country's CSIRT (`--country`)

CRA Art. 14 notifications go through ENISA's Single Reporting Platform to the CSIRT of your main establishment's Member State. Set it once (`"country": "ES"` in `.cra-audit.json`, `--country ES`, or the action's `country` input) and the Art. 14 notice, the JSON report (`reporting`) and `readiness` include that CSIRT's procedure.

**Spain — INCIBE-CERT** (verified against [INCIBE-CERT's CRA guidance](https://www.incibe.es/incibe-cert/blog/reglamento-de-ciberresiliencia-cra-que-es-quien-afecta-y-como-prepararse), 2026-09-09):

- SRP access is requested from INCIBE at **cve-coordination@incibe.es**, which validates the manufacturer before registration — request it before you need it.
- Incidents outside the CRA: **incidencias@incibe-cert.es**. Undisclosed vulnerabilities needing a CVE: INCIBE's CNA (**cve-coordination@incibe.es**).
- In doubt, report through INCIBE-CERT's usual channels; INCIBE tells you whether to file it in the SRP.
- `npx cra-audit readiness --init --lang es --country ES` writes a Spanish `SECURITY.md` with this procedure.

🇪🇸 Guía en español: [Notificar al INCIBE-CERT según el CRA](docs/es/notificar-incibe.md).

Other countries get the generic EU procedure for now; contributions with verified CSIRT procedures are welcome.

### GitHub data and rate limits

With `--github`, the tool queries the public GitHub API to fetch the last commit, contributors and stars. Unauthenticated, GitHub limits to **60 requests/hour**. For large projects, set a read-only token:

```bash
# PowerShell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_xxx"; npx cra-audit visualize --github
# bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx npx cra-audit visualize --github
```

The token is only used to add the `Authorization` header on calls to `api.github.com`; it is not stored or sent anywhere else.

---

## The visual report in detail

`cra-audit visualize` writes `cra-audit-report.html` (or the `-o` path) and opens it in the browser. The report is a **single HTML file** with all data embedded and the filtering/sorting logic in its own vanilla JavaScript (no third-party scripts), so it is safe to share and works offline.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Package | Component name (flags `deprecated` / `archived`). |
| Version | Installed version + `up to date` / `→ latest` indicator. |
| Latest | Latest version published on npm. |
| License | Detected license (red badge if missing or denied). |
| Vulnerability | Highest known severity (`clean` if none). |
| Last activity | Last commit date (with `--github`) or last publish date. |
| Maint. | Number of npm maintainers. |
| Contrib. | Number of GitHub contributors (with `--github`). |
| Maintenance | Score 0-100 based on recency, maintainers, contributors and status. |

Summary cards: total components, vulnerable, license issues, outdated and at risk.

---

## Security policy

Create a `.cra-audit.json` file at the project root to customize the rules (there is an example in `.cra-audit.example.json`):

```json
{
  "failOn": "high",
  "failOnKev": true,
  "country": "ES",
  "vulnerabilitySource": "osv",
  "requireSbom": true,
  "sbomFormat": "cyclonedx",
  "sbomCreator": "security@example.com",
  "productionOnly": false,
  "vulnerabilities": {
    "allowlist": []
  },
  "licenses": {
    "allow": [],
    "deny": ["GPL-3.0", "AGPL-3.0"],
    "failOnMissing": true
  }
}
```

- `failOn`: minimum severity that blocks the audit.
- `country`: ISO code of your main establishment (e.g. `ES`); decides the CSIRT in the Art. 14 guidance.
- `failOnKev`: fail when a dependency has an actively exploited vulnerability (CISA KEV). Default `true`.
- `vulnerabilitySource`: `osv` (OSV.dev + CISA KEV) or `npm` (`npm audit`).
- `requireSbom`: require the SBOM to meet the TR-03183-2 required data fields.
- `sbomFormat`: `cyclonedx` or `spdx`.
- `sbomCreator`: email or URL of the entity that creates the SBOM (usually the manufacturer).
- `productionOnly`: audit production dependencies only.
- `vulnerabilities.allowlist`: exploitability assessments (see [VEX](#6-vex--documenting-exploitability-vex)). Plain strings (a package name or a GHSA/CVE id) are still accepted. Malicious packages (`MAL-*`) cannot be allowlisted.
- `licenses.allow` / `licenses.deny`: allowed / denied lists (SPDX id).
- `licenses.failOnMissing`: treat undocumented licenses as a failure.

Command-line options take precedence over the policy file.

---

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Audit passed (or report generated successfully). |
| `1` | Audit failed or execution error. |

Suitable for CI/CD: a non-`0` code blocks the pipeline.

## GitHub Action

Available in the GitHub Marketplace as [CRA Compliance Audit](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cra-compliance-audit).

Python, Go and Java projects work as they are (the action reads `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`…). For other languages, or to include Maven's transitive dependencies, generate the SBOM first and pass it with `sbom-input`:

```yaml
      - uses: anchore/sbom-action@v0          # Syft
        with: { format: cyclonedx-json, output-file: sbom.cdx.json, upload-artifact: false }
      - uses: migohe14/cra-audit@v2
        with:
          sbom-input: sbom.cdx.json
          vex: vex.cdx.json
```

```yaml
name: CRA audit
on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write   # upload the SARIF report to code scanning

jobs:
  cra:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 22 }
      - run: npm ci                # installed packages give the SBOM its creators/licenses
      - uses: migohe14/cra-audit@v2
        with:
          fail-on: high
          sbom: sbom.cdx.json
          vex: vex.cdx.json
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: cra-evidence
          path: |
            sbom.cdx.json
            vex.cdx.json
            cra-audit.sarif
```

Every finding shows up in **Security → Code scanning**, pointing at the exact line of the lockfile; malicious packages and CISA KEV findings are errors, and advisories assessed as `not_affected` in the policy are shown as suppressed with their justification.

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Project to audit. |
| `fail-on` | `high` | Minimum severity that fails the job. |
| `fail-on-kev` | `true` | Fail on actively exploited (CISA KEV) vulnerabilities. |
| `production` | `false` | Production dependencies only. |
| `country` | — | Country of your main establishment (e.g. `ES`) for the Art. 14 CSIRT steps. |
| `sarif` | `cra-audit.sarif` | SARIF path (empty to skip). |
| `upload-sarif` | `true` | Upload to code scanning (needs `security-events: write`; private repos need GitHub Advanced Security). |
| `sbom` / `vex` | — | Also write the SBOM / VEX to these paths. |
| `sbom-input` | — | Audit this CycloneDX/SPDX SBOM instead of the npm lockfile (any language). |
| `args` | — | Extra `cra-audit audit` arguments. |

Outputs: `exit-code`, `sarif`, `sbom`, `vex`. Without the action, `npx cra-audit --sarif cra-audit.sarif` does the same in any CI.

## Programmatic API

```js
const {
  runAudit, loadPolicy, generateSbom, validateSbom,
  scanVulnerabilities, checkLicenses, parseLockfile,
  enrichComponents, buildHtml,
} = require('cra-audit');

const { policy, source } = loadPolicy(process.cwd());
const report = await runAudit(process.cwd(), policy, source);
console.log(report.gate.passed ? 'OK' : 'FAILED');

// Maintenance data + custom HTML report
const { components } = parseLockfile(process.cwd());
const signals = await enrichComponents(components, { network: true, github: true });
```

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18 (uses native `fetch` and `node --test`).
- Network access to `api.osv.dev` and `cisa.gov` (or `raw.githubusercontent.com` for the KEV mirror). `npm` on the `PATH` is only needed for `--vuln-source npm` or the offline fallback.
- A lockfile present: `package-lock.json` / `npm-shrinkwrap.json` (npm), `yarn.lock` (Yarn classic or Berry) or `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm). Run `npm install` / `yarn` / `pnpm install` if missing.
