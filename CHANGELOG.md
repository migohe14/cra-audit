# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Releases are automated: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag publishes the package to npm
(with provenance) and creates the GitHub Release from the matching section
below, so add the section before running `npm version`.

## [2.4.2] — Art. 14 notice: assess exploitability first

### Changed

- The Art. 14 notice now reads **"applies if this known exploited (CISA KEV) vulnerability is exploitable in your product"** and leads with the assessment: not exploitable → record a `not_affected` VEX statement; exploitable → notify the coordinating CSIRT and ENISA within 24 h / 72 h / 14 days of becoming aware.
- The audit check label and the SARIF message say "CRA Art. 14 reporting applies if exploitable in your product" instead of "may apply".

## [2.4.1] — Clearer CRA Art. 14 notice

### Changed

- The Art. 14 notice is now headed **"dependency with a known exploited vulnerability (CISA KEV)"** instead of "actively exploited vulnerability in a dependency". A KEV match means the vulnerability has been exploited somewhere; the reporting duty applies once you are aware that it is exploitable in your product (CRA Art. 3(42) and Art. 14(1)). The 24 h / 72 h / 14 days deadlines run from that awareness, not from the KEV listing.
- README and the Spanish INCIBE-CERT guide describe KEV matches as a trigger to assess and document with VEX, not as a started reporting clock.

## [2.4.0] — Report to your country's CSIRT (INCIBE-CERT for Spain)

### Highlights

- **`--country`** (policy `country`, action input `country`): the country of your main establishment decides where CRA Art. 14 notifications go. For **Spain**, the Art. 14 notice now shows INCIBE-CERT's procedure, verified against [INCIBE-CERT's CRA guidance](https://www.incibe.es/incibe-cert/blog/reglamento-de-ciberresiliencia-cra-que-es-quien-afecta-y-como-prepararse): SRP access requested from INCIBE (cve-coordination@incibe.es) with prior validation, incidents outside the CRA to incidencias@incibe-cert.es, and INCIBE's usual channels when in doubt.
- The JSON report carries a **`reporting`** block (CSIRT, SRP, deadlines, steps) for automation.
- **`readiness --init --lang es`** writes Spanish `SECURITY.md` and `security.txt` templates; with `--country ES` they include the INCIBE-CERT section, and `readiness` checks that the coordinating CSIRT is named. The checks understand Spanish wording.
- 🇪🇸 New guide in Spanish: [docs/es/notificar-incibe.md](docs/es/notificar-incibe.md).

### Fixes

- `require('cra-audit/package.json')` works again: the manifest is exported alongside the API, so tools that read dependency versions this way no longer fail with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

## [2.3.0] — Python, Go and Java without an SBOM tool

### Highlights

- **Native manifests**: `npx cra-audit` in a Python, Go or Java project reads `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `Pipfile.lock` or `requirements*.txt`, `go.mod`, `gradle.lockfile` and `pom.xml` directly — no Syft/cdxgen step and no package.json needed. Same checks as npm: OSV vulnerabilities, malicious packages, CISA KEV with the Art. 14 clock, VEX and SARIF.
- Findings and SARIF alerts point at the exact line of the manifest.
- Only exact versions are audited: unpinned requirements, parent/BOM-managed Maven versions and version ranges are skipped and reported, never guessed. `pom.xml` covers declared dependencies (transitive ones need a Maven-generated SBOM).
- Folders with an npm lockfile *and* one of these manifests are audited as a whole.
- For these ecosystems the audit warns (instead of failing) about the missing TR-03183 SBOM and undeclared licenses; `sbom generate` explains how to produce one.

## [2.2.0] — Any language through its SBOM

### Highlights

- **Input SBOM** (`-i/--input` for `audit`, `vuln`, `licenses` and `vex`; `sbom-input` in the GitHub Action): audit a CycloneDX JSON, SPDX 2.x JSON or SPDX 3.0 JSON-LD SBOM from Syft, cdxgen, Trivy or the CycloneDX build plugins instead of the npm lockfile. Components are looked up in OSV.dev by Package URL, so **Python, Java, Go, Rust, .NET, PHP, Ruby…** projects get known vulnerabilities, malicious packages, CISA KEV with the Art. 14 clock, licenses, VEX and SARIF. No package.json needed.
- SARIF alerts point at the purl's line in the SBOM; VEX statements use the components' real purls and the product's purl (or `pkg:generic`).
- The input SBOM's TR-03183-2 gaps are reported as a warning in the audit (`sbom check -i` still fails on them).
- `readiness` works in any repository (stops at the nearest package.json or .git) and accepts a committed SBOM file for non-npm projects.

### Fixes

- The SPDX validator no longer counts the described product as a component and accepts `CONTAINS` / `DEPENDENCY_OF` edges (as written by Syft).
- Fixed versions resolve with each ecosystem's naming (Maven `group:artifact`, PyPI normalisation) and Go `v`-prefixed versions.

## [2.1.1] — GitHub Marketplace

- The GitHub Action is published in the Marketplace as **CRA Compliance Audit** (the name "CRA Audit" is taken by a GitHub organization). Usage is unchanged: `uses: migohe14/cra-audit@v2`.

## [2.1.0] — VEX, SARIF & GitHub Action, CRA readiness

### Highlights

- **VEX** (`cra-audit vex`): writes a CycloneDX 1.6 or OpenVEX 0.2.0 document with the exploitability of every known vulnerability. Assessments live in `.cra-audit.json` (`status`, `justification`, `detail`) and are also honoured by the audit gate; accepting a vulnerability without a justification now raises a warning.
- **SARIF 2.1.0** (`--sarif <path>`): findings appear in GitHub code scanning at the exact lockfile line, with GitHub severities; malicious and CISA KEV findings are errors and `not_affected` assessments are shown as suppressed with their justification.
- **GitHub Action** (`uses: migohe14/cra-audit@v2`): runs the audit, uploads the SARIF to code scanning and can write the SBOM and VEX as build evidence.
- **CRA readiness** (`cra-audit readiness`): checks SECURITY.md, the vulnerability contact, the support period, security.txt (RFC 9116) and the Art. 14 reporting process. `--init` creates prefilled SECURITY.md and security.txt templates.

### Compatibility

- Plain-string allowlist entries keep working as before.

## [2.0.0] — OSV.dev, CISA KEV & malicious package detection

### Highlights

**Known, actively exploited and malicious dependencies — in one check**

- **OSV.dev** is now the default vulnerability source: every dependency is checked at the exact version pinned in the lockfile (npm, Yarn, pnpm), with severity, CVE aliases and the version that fixes it. `npm` is no longer required.
- **Malicious packages**: compromised releases from the OpenSSF malicious-packages feed (`MAL-*`, e.g. the Shai-Hulud worm versions) always fail the audit and cannot be allowlisted.
- **CISA KEV**: vulnerabilities with evidence of active exploitation fail the audit by default and print the **CRA Art. 14 reporting clock** (24 h / 72 h / 14 days). Use `--no-fail-on-kev` to report them as a warning.
- `--production` now follows the dependency graph, so it works for Yarn and pnpm projects too.
- The allowlist accepts GHSA and CVE identifiers.

### New options

- `--vuln-source osv|npm` / policy `vulnerabilitySource` (default `osv`)
- `--no-fail-on-kev` / policy `failOnKev` (default `true`)

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **CLI / CI usage is unchanged** (`npx cra-audit`), but the audit is stricter: malicious packages and actively exploited (KEV) vulnerabilities now fail it.
- **Programmatic API**: `runAudit()` and `scanVulnerabilities()` are now async — add `await`.
- Requires network access to `api.osv.dev` and `cisa.gov`. If OSV.dev is unreachable, the audit falls back to `npm audit` and says so.

## [1.1.0] — TR-03183-2 v2.1 SBOM

### Highlights

**CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM conforming to BSI TR-03183-2 v2.1.0**

- Full dependency graph from npm (v1–v3), Yarn classic/Berry and pnpm (v5–v9) lockfiles, with completeness declared in `compositions`
- SBOM creator (`--creator` flag or `sbomCreator` policy, defaulting to package.json) and component creators read from installed packages
- `bsi:component:filename` / `executable` / `archive` / `structured` properties, SHA-512 on the distribution reference, declared/concluded licenses, source code URI
- `sbom check` validates every TR-03183-2 v2.1 required field

### Fixes

- Licenses of Yarn/pnpm projects now reach the SBOM
- Yarn Berry workspace entries are no longer listed as third-party components
- pnpm v5 lockfile keys with peer suffixes are parsed correctly
- Malformed integrity digests no longer produce schema-invalid hashes

### ⚠️ Stricter validation

- CycloneDX < 1.6 and SPDX < 3.0.1 are flagged (use the default CycloneDX output)
- Yarn Berry projects fail the SHA-512 check (the lockfile doesn't store the npm tarball hash)
- Run it after installing dependencies: component creators and licenses are read from `node_modules`

## [1.0.0]

- Yarn (classic and Berry) and pnpm lockfile support
- CRA audit for npm projects: SBOM (CycloneDX/SPDX), `npm audit` vulnerabilities, licenses and an interactive HTML maintenance report
